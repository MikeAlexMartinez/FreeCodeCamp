-> 5 Elements of Effective Thinking (Book)

# 1 -> Understand Deeply

  Don't face complex issues head-on. First understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what
  is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don't know. Then see what's missingm identify 
  the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notions. There are degrees to
  understanding (it's not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock solid understanding
  is the foundation for success.

# 2 -> Make Mistakes (Fail To Succeed)

  Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes are great teachers.
  They highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding. They also show you which way to turn 
  next and they ignite your imagination.

# 3 -> Raise Questions

  Constantly create questions to clarify and extend yoru understanding. What's the real question? Working 
  on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime. Ideas are in the air - the right questions will bring them out
  and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible. 

# 4 -> Follow the flow of Ideas (The evolution of a subject)

  Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. A new
  idea is a beginning, not an end. Ideas are rare - milk them. Following the consequences of small ideas can 
  result in bug payoffs.

# 5 -> Change -> Improve and think effectively

  The unchanging element is change - by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think
  and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you 
  live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning.

is merely a refinement of everyday thinking."

Uncover the essence of a problem.

"That's a Meanie Genie"

Murray appeared from a lamp. 3 wishes.

wished to find jewel

9 stones -> one with jewel weiggs more.

Three groups of three

if six stones match we can elimate all six stones that have all been weighed leaving us with the remaining
three. If they don't match we keep the stones from the heavier set of scales eliminating the six we didn't
weight and also the three stones that were on the lighter side of the scales.

Once left with three stones we can repeat the same process.

If the two weighed stones match we keep the stone that wasn't weighed. If the weighed stones are different
we keep the heavier of the stones being weighed and discard the other stones.

Tips & Strategies

Just try something!

Be Systematic!

What are all the possibilities.

People get bogged down. Discarding original decisions and articulating why you are doing so 
is a very valuable exercise.

Systematically test assumptions instead of dismissing strategies out right without testing them.

Develop a strategy for gaining knowledge from the tools you have to work with.


"A shaky story"

Tips

Simplify problem and solve that to see if you learn any strategies or rules for the problem.

Stacey will have shook hands with the middle number of people.

Tips

Write things down -> articulate what you are thinking, assumptions you make and why you are making them.

See through assumptions to completion and step through scenarios methodically.

Consider all possibilities!

  Profit
     A dealer bought an article for $7, sold it for $8, bought it back for $9, and sold it for $10. How much 
     profit did she make?
      £2

  Late night cash
    David and Paul have £30, how much must david give paul so that paul has £10 more than david? 
      £5
    d = 30
    p = 30
    d - 5 = 25
    p + 5 = 35
    p - d = 10

  A fair fare:
     Three strangers, Bob, Mary, and Ivan, meet at a taxi stand and decide to share a cab to cut down the 
     cost. They have different destinations, but all the destinations are right on the highway leading from 
     the airport, so no circuitous driving is required. Bob’s destination is 10 miles away, Mary’s is 20 
     miles, and Ivan’s is 30 miles. The taxi costs $1.50 per mile including the tip regardless of the number 
     of passengers. How much should each person pay? (Note: There is more than one way of looking at this 
     situation.

     Total distance travelled is 30 + 20 + 10 = 60
     cab fare = 1.5 * 30 = 45
     cost per mile is 45 / 60 = 0.75
     Bob = 7.50
     Mary = 15
     Ivan = 22.50
     total = 45


Infinity
Sharing candy before you can count!
  Can match two things up in correspondence. Tell if shared equally.
  If they have the same cardinality they are said to be equal in size (when dealing with infinity)

Key is to understand the question. Once you understand the question you can make a reasonable attmept 
at finding a solution.
