A Project Specification document outlines the scope of a project to
stakeholders.

A Project spec acts as a blueprint for a website. It communicates the 
specific details about the project that need to be planned for, budgeted
for and implemented.

It gives an accurate impression of the purpose, scope, timeline, and 
functionality involved in the project.

The more thorough the specs the more accurate the estimate will be. In this
way it is in your best interest to be as thorough as possible in your 
specification.

Common Elements for a Project Spec:
  - Introduction - description of project
  - Project Objectives
  - Site User Roles - What types of roles will site users have.
  - Functional Requirements Per User Role
  - Design Specifications - how things should look and feel visually
  - Flow or Logic Diagrams - for non-trivial processes 
  - Success Criteria - how to know if your website is doing it's job.
  - Site Map - The architecture, often in outline form, of the site content.
  - Content Plan - type of content, and where the content will come from.
  - Marketing Plan - how will the site make money.
  - Site Maintenance - who will maintain the site
  - Project Timeline - described timeline for completion.
  - Budget - how much can be set aside for the project.
