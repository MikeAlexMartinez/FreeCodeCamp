# So, What is Markdown?

Markdown was created in 2004 by John Gruber with contributions and feedback from Aaron Schwartz.

It is described by Gruber as:

  "A text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read,
  easy-to-write plan text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)" 

Markdown is two different things:
  > A simple syntax to create documents in plan text
  > A software tool written in PERL that convert the plain text to HTML

Main features:
  > Easy to use
  > Fast
  > Clean
  > Flexible
  > Portable
  > Made for writers




# Installation

DONE!

# Quick Start

> Inserting paragraphs and Line breaks

A Paragraph of text is one or more consecutive lines of text.

  A paragraph,
  divided into two lines.

becomes

  <p>A paragraph,
  divided into two lines.</p>

Paragraphs separated by one or more lines will create new paragraphs:

  A paragraph

  Another paragraph, separated by a new line.

becomes:

  <p>A paragraph</p>
  <p>Another paragraph, separated by a new line.</p>  

Two or more sentences at the end of a sentence creates a line break

  A sentence,  
  with a line break.  

becomes:

  <p>A sentence, <br />
  with a line break</p>

> Inserting Headers

There are two styles: setext and atx.
-setext style

There are two top level headers <h1> and <h2>

  Header 1
  ========

  Header 2
  --------

becomes:

  <h1>Header 1</h1>
  <h2>Header 2</h2>

-atx style

Begin a Paragraph with a hash and that paragraph becomes a header. number of hashes
dictates which header level it is.

  # Header 1
  ## Header 2
  ### Header 3
  #### Header 4
  ##### Header 5
  ###### Header 6

We close the Header with the same number of hashes.

e.g.

  # Header 1 #
  ## Header 2 ##
  ### Header 3 ###
  #### Header 4 ####
  ##### Header 5 #####
  ###### Header 6 ######

becomes:

  <h1>Header 1</h1>
  <h2>Header 2</h2>
  <h3>Header 3</h3>
  <h4>Header 4</h4>
  <h5>Header 5</h5>
  <h6>Header 6</h6>

> Inserting emphasis

a single * or underscore creates an <em> while double * or underscores create a strong element

  *single asterisks*
  _single underscores_
  **double asterisks**
  __double underscores__

becomes

  <em>single asterisks</em>
  <em>single underscores</em>
  <strong>double asterisks</strong>
  <strong>double underscores</strong>

> Inserting Lists

-Ordered Lists use numbers as list markers

  1. One
  2. Two
  6. Six

becomes:

  <ol>
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
    <li>Six</li>
  </ol>

- Unordered lists use astericks, plus signs and hyphens as list markers

  * A list.
  * Second element.
  + A new entry.
  - Another entry in a list.
  - And the list goes on.

becomes:

  <ul>
    <li>A list.</li>
    <li>Second element.</li>
    <li>A new entry.</li>
    <li>Another entry in a list.</li>
    <li>And the list goes on.</li>
  </ul>

Lists can be nested withe the use of spaces. (Might have to be 4 spaces?)

e.g.

  - First level
      - Second level
          - Third level
      - Second level again

becomes:

<ul>
  <li>First level
  <ul><li>Second level
      <ul><li>Third level</li></ul></li>
      <li>Second level again</li></ul></li>
</ul>


> Inserting Links

Two styles of links:

  inline & reference

- inline

We use square brackes to wrap the exposed text, and use brackets to mark the link. A title attribute
is created with the use of "" after the link.

  An example of [inline link](http://example.com "Example").
  [This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.  

becomes:

  <p>An example of <a href="http://example.com"title="Example">inline link</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="http://example.net/">This link</a> has no titleattribute.</p>

- Reference

You can create the stucture of the link in the text:

  This is [an example][id] reference-style link.
  This is [an example] [id] reference-style link.

then later, reference this link with the details:

  [id]: http://example.com/ "Optional Title Here"

You can use " ' or ( to wrap optional title.

Or you can reference the link text directly.

e.g.

  This is [another example] reference-style link.

then:

  [another example]: http://example.com/

> Inserting Automatic Links

Can be created by wrapping a URL in angle brackes < >

e.g.

  <http://example.com/>

becomes:

  <p><a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a></p>
